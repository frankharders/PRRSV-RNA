# PRRSV-RNA
# Several scripts for constructing the PRRSV genome from reference based mapping.
contains 1 folder with the general reference genome for PRRSV (ref.fa)

## Steps:
Check:
- presence of the folder references containing the file "ref.fa". 
Otherwise copy or clone it again. If the scripts is used for other genomes adjust the reference accordingly.

Constructing the genome
1. start the script PRRSV-consensus.sh
2. check the output in the folder "dbMAPPING" using IGV.

check the quality of the fastq files
1. fastqc on raw input files
2. fastqc on polished read files
